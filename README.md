# Debloat-without-linux-PC-Tuning
An easier way to use the debloat proposed by amitxv instead of having to use linux. 

The file is in .net 7 but using AOT so you don't need to install the net api.  

To use run start.bat  


if you want to do your own build use the command "dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release" in terminal 
and after exit the final file will be "net7.0\win-x64-native".
